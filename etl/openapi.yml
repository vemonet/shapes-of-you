  description: "Get predicted targets for a given entity: the **potential drugs treating a given disease**, or the **potential diseases a given drug could treat**.
    \n\n* Use the `/predict` operation to easily retrieve predictions for a given entity (operation annotated for the [BioThings Explorer](https://x-bte-extension.readthedocs.io/en/latest/x-bte-kgs-operations.html)).
    \n\n* Predictions are currently produced using the [PREDICT method](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3159979/) from the [fair-workflows/openpredict](https://github.com/fair-workflows/openpredict) project. 
    \n\n* You can also install the [OpenPredict Python package](https://pypi.org/project/openpredict/) to train and serve a new model yourself.
    \n\n* More documentation available at [github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/translator-openpredict](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/translator-openpredict)
